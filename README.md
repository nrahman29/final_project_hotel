Project description

This is the final project in the Machine Learning and AI course conducted by ReDi School. The aim of the project is to
create a machine learning model using a training dataset to predict whether a hotel booking will be cancelled on a 
testing dataset. The datasets are based on a real world data from a journal article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191 

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning will be carried out. 
Features will be transformed and new features will be created in order to implement a binary classification model.
Feature importance will also be determined by plotting of graphs.

Finally, the machine learning model will be evaluated using classification metrics.
